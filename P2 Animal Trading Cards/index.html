			<p class="description">Hummingbirds are small, colorful birds with iridescent feathers. Their name comes from the fact that they
                flap their wings so fast (about 80 times per second) that they make a humming noise. Hummingbirds can fly
                right, left, up, down, backwards, and even upside down. They are also able to hover by flapping their wings
                in a figure-8 pattern. They have a specialized long and tapered bill that is used to obtain nectar from
                the center of long, tubular flowers.</p>
