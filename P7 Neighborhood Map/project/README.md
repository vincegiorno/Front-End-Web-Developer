`First of all, thanks for your patience to my project. I think implement KO with Google Autocomplete and searchBox is unnecessary and complicate things, besides I haven't found any successful implementation example on the Web and the links provided doesn't help. Aslo when I implemented KO with zoom address in l179, as user select a prediction and hit Go, Google only takes in the part you typed, not the prediction. For example, if I type 'san' and select 'San Gabriel, CA, United States' and hit Go, the map will zoom to San Diego. That's why I want to use the code in l178 without KO.`
